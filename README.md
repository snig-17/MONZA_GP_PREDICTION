### Key Research Findings
- **Grid position**: Strongest predictor (coefficient: 0.516)
- **Constructor tier**: Second most significant factor (coefficient: 2.027)
- **Track type**: Modest but significant effect (coefficient: -0.318)
- **Model R²**: 0.611 (explains 61.1% of variance)

*"Grid position emerged as the strongest predictor of the final outcome, reinforcing the importance of qualifying performance"*

## 🚀 Code Implementation

This repository contains the practical implementation of the research using:
- **Real Data**: FastF1 API for 2024 Monza data
- **Enhanced Features**: Extended beyond the 3 research variables
- **Production Ready**: Scikit-learn implementation for live predictions
